# FinalProject1

My partner and I worked on it from my computer that is the reason we only have one contributor but we both worked on it together and made this project work. She did the csv file and the test case file. I did the index php file. Please consider her effort in this project equally. As of now, out heroku link that was created isn't showing our project but the php code works and creates the table as wanted. Thank you.
